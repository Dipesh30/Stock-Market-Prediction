## Introduction

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the volatility and complexity of financial data. This project utilizes GRU, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model and predict stock prices based on historical data. GRUs are effective in capturing time-dependent patterns, making them suitable for time series forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical stock prices. You can obtain stock market data from sources like:

- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)

Place the dataset in the `data/` directory, ensuring it's in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on GRUs and includes the following layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts historical stock price data.
2. **GRU Layers**: Captures temporal dependencies in the data.
3. **Dense Layer**: Outputs the predicted stock price.
4. **Activation Function**: Typically uses ReLU or linear activation for output.

You can find the model architecture in `src/model.py`.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:Dipesh30/Stock-Market-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd stock-market-prediction
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions. To predict stock prices for a given dataset, run:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --data path/to/your/data.csv
The script will output the predicted stock prices along with visualizations comparing predicted vs. actual prices.
